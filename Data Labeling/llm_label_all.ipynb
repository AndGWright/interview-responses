And just for people listening or reading this transcript of our conversation, just to review, a couple of salient points. One is that the indictment of Eric Adams says essentially that he was involved in ripping off a system for $10 million, which is the amount of matching funds that he got. We\\u2019ve also seen a candidate for comptroller also be subject to federal prosecution charges, in his case dismissed, in connection with a matching funds scheme involving straw donors as well, and it goes down the line. So when you\\u2019re talking about systemic issues, we\\u2019re talking about those cases, and other cases for city council and so on, where we\\u2019ve seen people abusing the system. So I\\u2019m wondering what your thoughts are about how to fix the system? And clearly this will require city charter reform as well. You can call a commission and someone, but ultimately, you need the voters of New York City to be voting for this reform when everyone in the political system already benefits from this large amount of public financing that got them in office in the first place.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"interviewee\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Brad Lander\",\n          \"Jessica Ramos\",\n          \"Whitney Tilson\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 410,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"And I encourage everyone to go to thecity.nyc.

And truly, if you don't feel that I\\u2019ve answered it, I want to keep going until I\\u2019ve answered it. To be a little more specific about larger-scale dollar numbers, and then I'll go to your question, I also believe that we need to bring down the NYPD\\u2019s near billion-dollar overtime. I think that we need to eliminate that overtime. I think that we need to disband the Strategic Response Group. I also believe that we need to cancel the proposal to build what has been dubbed \\u201cCop City.\\u201d Now these are different proposals that I\\u2019m putting forward that would save the city hundreds of millions, more than a billion dollars.\",\n          \"Yes, I think there is absolutely a necessity of competency and of being a competent manager, specifically. I also think that you need to understand where your knowledge goes up until and who you need to help you to go beyond that. I have seen in previous mayoral administrations, across the ideological spectrum, examples that I would love to bring into my administration of how you can empower the people who know the most about the work that you're seeking to accomplish. I think that it is especially critical in a time when we have a mayor who views himself as more of a monarch, as someone who must answer every question, who must decide every agency directive, who must be in the room deciding whether or not an elected official can even meet with that agency, that we have someone who will empower the New Yorkers who are the best and brightest of our city. And that we give them the authority to actually follow through on that mandate. And furthermore, I do not believe that every single head of an agency needs to align with me 100% across every single issue, but rather specifically on that issue of that agency. For example, I'm a big critic, often, of Michael Bloomberg\\u2019s mayoralty. I also look with deep admiration at his empowering of Janette Sadik-Khan to be the head of the Department of Transportation, and how that reshaped the streetscape across New York City. And I think that those are the kinds of examples.

It is also something that, if we're actually looking at the numbers, there are not as many New Yorkers as is often conceived that are actually living on our subway platforms.
