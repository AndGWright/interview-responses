       "  'question': 'Thank you, comptroller. So you talked about the issue of mental illness and the nexus of disorder and you talked about the [Daniel] Penny case this week. What would you do in the specific case of someone like Mr. Neely, who was getting significant amounts of help from New York City government, and who walked away from a residential treatment facility that he was supposed to go into that facility as part of his bargain for a series of assaults on a woman? There was a warrant for his arrest at the time he died on the train. Would you have specifically prevented him from walking away, do you think he should have been arrested once he walked away? In other words, how do you get people help when they don’t know that they need help, when they don’t want help, without coercing them?',\n",
       "  'interviewee': 'Brad Lander',\n",
       "  'response': \"Thank you for the question, and thank you for the stuff you've been writing on this, like both Times pieces. After your piece on the SCOUT [Subway Co-Response Outreach Team] program, I reached out to [MTA chair] Janno [Lieber] and said, can I go do a SCOUT visit, and can I get that data? And the more recent articles on what happens when you focus the system on leniency are really helpful. We looked at this a lot. We did an audit of the Intensive Mobile Treatment program. We focused in that instance on the case of this guy, Rashid Brimmage. Very similar — like 92 arrests, in and out of hospitals, in and out of jail. And when the Times reporter spotted him, he was on the subway with his hospital bracelet still on his wrist. So it’s systemic breakdown. I will get to Daniel Penny, but I want to say first, what I think is required to make this work is one, mayoral attention. It’s a discoordinated system, and unless [the Department of] Correction and H+H [NYC Health + Hospitals] and [the Department of] Homeless Services know that the mayor is focused on it, knows who these individuals are, and wants every week to see what progress looks like, nothing is going to improve. You need a more coordinated continuum of care. The data shows that a “housing first” approach works 70% to 90% of the time, which means it doesn't work 10% to 30% of the time, and those are serious cases. But taking it here, like they have in Denver and Salt Lake and Houston would mean a 70-90% reduction in the number of homeless, mentally ill folks on the street, who in most cases, a stable apartment and services does actually work for them. If you can get on the subway, not worrying about whether that person is [Jordan Neely] or Rashid Brimmage, because they are stably housed, that’ll be a lot more happy New Yorkers and a lot more stable people. For the 10% to 30% of the times it doesn’t work, more secure options are needed. First, that is building a secure detention facility. Beds at H+H, the 300 of which were supposed to be already delivered, in which the Adams administration delayed by two years, those are folks who have been, who are in DOC custody, so are in detention. But we need that. And then we do need some more secure options. There’s this thing, AOT, Assisted Outpatient Treatment, that people can be mandated to, but the “O” is for outpatient, so if they’re homeless but mandated outpatient treatment, it works pretty badly. And I think having some more mandated and secure facilities, which are inpatient, is one piece of the continuum of care I would like to — as you heard me in talking about it, I would like to focus on the Housing First elements that could get most of those folks in stable housing and services in a way that works for them and for everyone else — at the same time, we need more secure beds, and that's got to be part of the system we built.\",\n",

I mean, obviously, there was a huge rise in the first year of the pandemic, and then in some cases quite modest declines, but still with numbers about 30% above pre-pandemic levels. Shootings up a lot, obviously, theft, you know, retail theft, also up a lot. Murders and gun violence below where they were last year, but still way up from where they were before the pandemic.',\n",

Murders came down from last year to this year a little bit, but I think are still about 30% above the pre-pandemic levels and shootings overall up a lot. And that’s a place, I mean, I was talking to [Brooklyn District Attorney] Eric Gonzalez about what he’s trying to do is focus on investigating every shooting with the level that they bring to homicides. Shootings where there is a victim, with the idea that they haven’t been getting nearly as much attention. Clearance rates on murders are decent in New York, but clearance rates on shootings are still quite low. And when they are able to get the cops to focus on those things in partnership with them, they can quite often track that back to whoever shot the gun and then actually do something about it. That is not always easy. They have seen a rise in young people being the shooters, which presents a real set of challenges for how you address that issue. But I think mostly this is a police management issue. When you've got a department led by someone who’s running a protection racket with his brother, that does not help you get focused on the areas where you need to have real accountability. And I've been talking to folks like Ken Corey, who’s running the Policing Leadership Academy at the University of Chicago Crime Lab. They have a much more disciplined model for how you are, both training people to be good managers at the precinct level and using the data to drive better outcomes. And that is what works in policing.\",\n",

It’s like you’re using data in partnership at the precinct level to see where things are, to be working with the district attorneys and to be coming up with the solutions on investigating each individual crime and trying to clear them so that you can actually get those folks off the street. That’s the model. I guess I've been focused more on shootings than on felony assault so far, and thinking about what the strategy actually is. There was that Gothamist article that showed that, you know, 4% of the city’s 120,000 blocks account for essentially all of the shootings of the last decade. Those are the same blocks on which we're spending for community-based violence interruption, but with really no approach to outcomes. Like, what are we getting? What's coming down? Is there dialogue between those groups and the precincts in the places where you've got the most shootings? That’s an outcomes-based management approach to focusing on confronting the problems. I think the same would work on the felony assaults.\",\n",

And on this program it should have been, we want to test what the cost is. What food are people buying? Are we saving money on food and shelters? That would have been a good idea. It should have been bid. None of it got rigorously evaluated, so we really don't know if it saved money.\",\n",

For the federal government to allow in so many folks who are undocumented and provide essentially no resources to the communities receiving them was terrible. So there’s a question about border policy, which is not a local one. But it is the federal government’s responsibility to meet people's rights to seek asylum. And they should have had a program like they did for Ukrainians and Afghans to provide the resources to communities, not just for shelter, but for some program that helps people actually get the legal services so you could file your asylum application or TPS [Temporary Protected Status] if you’re eligible, and then get some workforce development and job placement. So yes, all of that should be funded federally, and I share the frustration that it wasn't. At the same time, it still would have been better if seeing that it wasn’t coming, that was the approach New York City had taken. We would have saved money already if we had said, “Okay, it's got to be pro bono legal assistance.”We're going to be able to afford to give everybody a lawyer for it. They did a little piece of this at the Asylum Application Help Center after we agitated for it. And several thousand people were able to file their asylum papers, and then were eligible six months later for work authorization, except that then they got evicted from shelter in 30 or 60 days, and lost their mail. The city lost track of them and wasn’t able to implement a more effective system for helping say, “Okay, now you're six months on from having filed you can get your work authorization, and here are a set of jobs that we can help you into.” Is it fair that the city would have needed to spend city taxpayer dollars where federal dollars should have been sent?

I have a two part question, both related to supply. One is I think we’ve seen with de Blasio and Adams have really, I think, maxed out on the levers that they directly control. Zoning being one of them, capital funding, capital investments, right? And that’s been the playbook with a little bit of action in Albany, but on the margins. The first part of the question is just, what are you going to do to build on those, including what you were going to do in Albany. And related to that, I think there’s a lot of skepticism about adding to supply as being part of the solution. Some of that is coming from folks who are just skeptical, having seen transformations of neighborhoods like Williamsburg and displacement related to that. But I think it also relates to things we’re seeing now, especially post-COVID, where we see, for example, people keeping an apartment here, maybe having one somewhere else, people have been hoarding housing in some ways, or using it part-time. So I think the skepticism is more warranted, perhaps, than it was in the past. Simply adding supply may not put it in the hands of working people. But how would you make sure that people who don't have huge amounts of money have access to housing?\",\n",

       "  'response': \"First, I really do think, Gowanus for me is the model. I want to scale what I did there. I don’t know how many of you are buying. We got a lot of Brooklynites around the table. It’s amazing what’s going up there. We thought it would be 8,000 units over 10 years. It’s probably 8,000 units already. 3,000 of them genuinely and deeply affordable, the low-income and working-class families. And we made it so that also, the 1,500 families in the Gowanus and Wyckoff Houses are getting a modernization of their development as well. We were able to build a durable coalition for growth, not because we said to people, “you must believe in supply as the strategy for housing affordability.” I believe that we need more supply as a strategy for housing affordability. We did in Gowanus, instead of a kind of a lecture on, “there must be more housing supply,” “what would growth look like that you saw yourself in and were excited about?” That’s why, you know, we worked with those public housing tenants on improving their homes and all the artists who feared getting displaced. And there’s artists studios in the new buildings that are going up, and there's some preservation of industrial spaces. The Brooklyn Granary, everyone’s going to be getting their bread from the Brooklyn Granary that’s going at 300 Huntington. We facilitated a big new housing development, but also made it possible to keep manufacturing, industrial and some construction businesses.\",\n",

       "  'interviewee': 'Brad Lander',\n",
       "  'response': \"Yeah, so that took some work. We built that vision: biggest affordable housing rezoning, but overwhelming supported by the community board. One example that I think could help drive much more belief in the value of supply and growth is a focus on affordable homeownership. A kind of the modern version, which everyone is always talking about, but that you could actually deliver on, for what a 21st-century Mitchell-Lama–type model would be. This will involve Albany and New York City, and it'll involve more density and some subsidy. Because you could take outer-borough neighborhoods that are currently low-rise and have a strip like Coney Island Avenue where there’s a lot of low-rise commercial and say, there’s going to be much more density here. You've got a low-rise neighborhood, and there’s going to be the kinds of buildings going up in Gowanus. But a big chunk of that is going to be affordable, multi-family co-ops, with restricted sales prices, but some opportunity for appreciation, but they stay affordable, that makes some ownership possible for the next generation of working- and middle-class New Yorkers. My idea is to say, we’ve got that model. OK? It’s a rezoning that involves some more density, that a big chunk of it will be affordable, co-op, home-ownership. A mix of density and subsidy. We’re going to start in the first five neighborhoods where community boards vote they would like to commence a rezoning like that. And then still work with you on working out the details of that rezoning. And I really believe we'll get five community boards who say, “we want to start that.” And now it’s not City Hall who pointed at your neighborhood on a map, or a developer who proposed it, but an idea for what growth looks like. So I do think there’s more to do on neighborhood-based rezoning that centers affordable homeownership and the kinds of things that people think will support their growing neighborhoods. Look, I supported “City of Yes.” There is more to do on supply overall. There’s a bunch of models like more shared housing, things where people would have five or six bedrooms and a common kitchen, the kinds of things that college students are looking for after they graduate. So there’s a lot to do on overall supply. There’s a lot to do on those kinds of neighborhood rezoning where people could see themselves in growth. You’re right. People are skeptical, which is why building a more durable long-term coalition for growth has to be a big part of the strategy.\",\n",

It's roughly 1%, every property should be taxed at the same percentage of its value, and that means not trying to tax rentals based on comparable sales, but on their value. So we go into a lot of detail on what that would look like. And yes, it would reduce the tax rate forward-going on new multi-family rentals by about a third, without subsidy. Big problem right now is if you own a piece of ground and you’re thinking about building, the tax rate if you do it as condos is a third less than the tax rate you do it as rentals.
